Few pointers for what I expect in penpa links. 
<ol>
<li>Some of you have gone to the trouble of making your own submission spreadsheets. 
This works brilliantly for me, and I would recommend that everyone does this. 
I think the authors of Round 1 will vouch for the fact that it makes it easier for everyone.</li>
<li>In the spreadsheet, keep a column for edit links. Even if you don't have one for solve links, 
it is fine. Edit links are the base of operations anyway. To get to a solve link from an edit link 
is easy, vice versa isn't that easy as it requires solving.</li>
<li>Here is a template of a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2heg9jnk">penpa link</a>. 
Mainly, note the fields of Title, Author, Rules, source. Try to keep all of these consistent. 
A little bit more on each field. </li>
<ol>
  <li>Title - We follow the system of: [(overall Sudoku number in the contest) - (Sudoku Name including the word "Sudoku") (Size - 6x6 or 9x9) (added number if Classic for instance we have 1 and 2 for 6x6 and 1234 for 9x9)</li>
  <li>Author - Put your full names as on <a href="https://logicmastersindia.com/SM/2023sm.asp">Logic Masters India</a> or the respective link for subsequent years. If you have an issue with your name and want it displayed some other way, note it when that link is shared itself, ideally.</li>
  <li>Rules - We are standardizing all the rules. We copy from here - https://github.com/vopani/sudokuib/tree/main/variations . You can bookmark the link. Its pretty easy to find the respective variant. If you are using a novel variant or something that isn't there, you can put the Classic part and write the second paragraph as you wish, minimizes the portion I (or whoever is in my position as editor) needs to work on.</li>
  <li>Source - The source is always easy to know. The link I've put in the source of the sample above is for SM round 1 2023. The only part you'll need to change for subsequent rounds or years is the "SM202301".</li>
</ol>
<li>This is only for Sudoku (I may not do a counterpart of this mail to the puzzle side because all of the people reading this mail are also there for PR except for Chandrachud who I'm already conversing with separately for round 2), but you can click on tab and select the 3 Sudoku options.</li>
</ol>
